### About me

I am a full stack software engineer with over 10 years expereinces in both front-end and back-end. 

More details you can see at my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dengkefeng/) - Dont repeat myself.

Also, I actively contribute to open source projects (see my GitHub profile) because it is a way to develop great software that benefits both the contributor and the community.
