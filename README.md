# Kefeng's Blog

I am always trying to write some blogs, but I am too lazy to setup a blog website for myself. 

But now, I have decided to use Github as my personal blog, since I have written some documents for my team, and realised a GIT repository might be a good place for blogging.

### About me

I am a full stack software engineer with over 10 years expereinces in both front-end and back-end. 

More details you can see at my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dengkefeng/) - Dont repeat myself.

Also, I actively contribute to open source projects (see my GitHub profile) because it is a way to develop great software that benefits both the contributor and the community.
